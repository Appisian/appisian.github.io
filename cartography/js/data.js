The billion stars observed only make up 1% of the stars in our galaxy. \nGaia is a revolution for astrometry, the science of measuring the position and movement of stars. Gaia is 400000 times more able than the human eye and allows scientists to better understand the structure of the Milky Way and dark matter.",
